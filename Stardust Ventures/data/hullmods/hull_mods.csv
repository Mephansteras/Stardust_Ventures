Increases maximum burn level by %s, maneuverability by %s, and maximum combat speed by %s.","Increases burn level, maneuverability, and top speed",Increases maximum burn level by a further %s.,graphics/hullmods/stardust_enhanced_engines.png
Stardust Core Field,stardust_StardustCore,2,,Stardust Ventures,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.stardust_StardustCore,"An intricate and proprietary system that shunts a good chunk of the ship's power supplies to better travel through hyperspace. Decreases the effect of operating in a solar corona has on combat readiness by %s; also has the same effect against storms in deep hyperspace. Also currently improving hyperspace agility by %s for the whole fleet (depending on the percentage of ships with Stardust Cores).

In combat, reduces energy damage taken by %s.",Increases hyperspace agility and reduces damage from hazards and energy.,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_StardustCore.png
Harmonic Resonators,stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator,2,,Stardust Ventures,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator,"An advanced but delicate system that dynamically adjusts the fleet's warp bubble to adapt to changing situations. Currently improving hyperspace agility by %s (along with Stardust Cores), and reduces the nebula speed penalty and the chance of navigational hazards like warp strikes and asteroids by %s. Only one Harmonic Resonator can be active in a fleet at a time. ",Reduces nebula speed penalty and chances of a hyperspace accident. ,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator.png
Environmental Shielding,stardust_EnvironmentalShielding,2,,Stardust Ventures,"defensive, req_spaceport, merc, standard","Defenses, Logistics, Requires Dock",5000,,,,2,4,6,12,data.hullmods.stardust_EnvironmentalShielding,"A suite of upgrades to the standard Stardust Ventures environmental protections that completely mitigates the effects of operating in a solar corona or being hit by hyperspace storms. Typically seen on Exploration ships, but often installed on their escorts and logistics vessels as well. Can only be installed on ships with Stardust Core Fields.",Completely negates the effect of being in corona.,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_Environmental.png
Advance Survey Drones,stardust_AdvanceSurveyDrones,2,,Stardust Ventures,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.stardust_AdvanceSurveyDrones,"A set of specialized survey drones that allow for preliminary survey scan without entering orbit of the planet. Base scan distance is %s, increased by %s per ship with Survey Drones up to a maximum of %s. Also reduces the heavy machinery and supplies required to perform surveys by %s.",Allows for remote preliminary planet surveys.,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_AdvanceSurveyDrones.png
