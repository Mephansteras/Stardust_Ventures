Stardust Core Field,stardust_StardustCore,2,,Stardust Ventures,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.stardust_StardustCore,"An intricate and proprietary system that shunts a good chunk of the ship's power supplies to better travel through hyperspace. Decreases the effect of operating in a solar corona has on combat readiness by %s; also has the same effect against storms in deep hyperspace. Also currently improving hyperspace agility by %s for the whole fleet (depending on the percentage of ships with Stardust Cores).

In combat, reduces energy damage taken by %s.",Increases hyperspace agility and reduces damage from hazards and energy.,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_StardustCore.png
Harmonic Resonators,stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator,2,,Stardust Ventures,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator,"An advanced but delicate system that dynamically adjusts the fleet's warp bubble to adapt to changing situations. Currently improving hyperspace agility by %s (along with Stardust Cores), and reducing navigation penalties from terrain by %s (Along with Navigation skill or other enhancers). Having multiple Harmonic Resonators will not increase these stats, but the best enhancement for each can have an effect.",Reduces nebula speed penalty and chances of a hyperspace accident. ,,graphics/hullmods/stardust_WarpHarmonicResonator.png
