stardust_stormrunner,SHIP,"A fast escort Frigate, the Storm Runner is fragile but hard hitting. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_ionskimmer,SHIP,"A very fast but fragile corvette, the Ion Skimmer is used either as a fast escort ship or to ferry crew and supplies quickly between systems. While too weak to last long in a real battle, it can hold its own against many of the smaller pirate frigates. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_horizonchaser,SHIP,"A small survey ship with excellent range and speed, the Horizon Chaser is a great addition to any budding exploration fleet. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,

This speed makes it excellent both as an escort and as a hunter to finish off smaller ships. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_starlightguard_pirate,SHIP,"A frankenstein mash of several ships based around a Starlight Guard core. This is a fast raiding ship favored by certain pirate groups, and excels at chasing down unguarded merchant vessels. The delicate Solar Shielding tech that used to be installed did not survive the pirate mechanics tinkering.",,,
stardust_stormseeker,SHIP,"A heavy attack Destroyer, the Storm Seeker is designed to do strong hit-and-run flanking attacks. The spinal mount Large ballistics weapon gives it both high firepower and excellent role customization, although flux cost of the loadout can be a serious limiter compared to larger ships. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_stormseeker_c,SHIP,"A varient of the Storm Seeker, this design replaces the spinal Large Ballistic mount with a small fighter bay.

stardust_meteorite,SHIP,"Fast and armed with a pair of light proton guns the meteorite wing can provide both effective ship strafing as well as enemy missile and fighter interception. The lack of any heavier ordnance does mean they cannot do much more than provide pressure against most war ships, however.",,,
stardust_gammaracer,SHIP,"Stardust Venture's take on the light interceptor concept, the Gamma Racer is considerably more survivable than a Talon by including a shield system, although at considerably higher cost.
