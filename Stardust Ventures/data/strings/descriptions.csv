stardust_stormrunner,SHIP,"A fast escort Frigate, the Storm Runner is fragile but hard hitting. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_ionskimmer,SHIP,"A very fast but fragile corvette, the Ion Skimmer is used either as a fast escort ship or to ferry crew and supplies quickly between systems. While too weak to last long in a real battle, it can hold its own against many of the smaller pirate frigates. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_horizonchaser,SHIP,"A small survey ship with excellent range and speed, the Horizon Chaser is a great addition to any budding exploration fleet. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_starlightguard,SHIP,"A fast escort Destroyer, the Starlight Guard is designed to take a beating while still being quick enough to keep up with all but the fastest frigates. This speed makes it excellent both as an escort and as a hunter to finish off smaller ships. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_starlightguard_pirate,SHIP,"A frankenstein mash of several ships based around a Starlight Guard core. This is a fast raiding ship favored by certain pirate groups, and excels at chasing down unguarded merchant vessels. The delicate Solar Shielding tech that used to be installed did not survive the pirate mechanics tinkering.",,,
stardust_stargazer,SHIP,"A medium survey ship with excellent range and speed, the Stargazer is the mainstay of many exploration fleets. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_sunbeamrider,SHIP,"The primary logistics ship of Stardust Ventures, the Sunbeam Rider carries a good amount of both cargo and fuel and is considerably faster than other freight ships of its class. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_voidnomad,SHIP,"A long range Exploration Cruiser, the Void Nomad includes built-in salvage gantries to help make the most of any expedition. It is a good bit faster than a Venture, but less robust and is not designed for heavy combat. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_stormherald,SHIP,"A swift strike cruiser, the Storm Herald is often used for anti-piracy patrols of major shipping lanes due to its long range and excellent speed. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_cosmicwind,SHIP,"A fast carrier designed to keep up with swift moving exploration fleets, the Cosmic Wind is lighter but faster than a Heron. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_solarflare,SHIP,"One of the largest Stardust Ventures designs, this ship is a fast battlecarrier designed to tackle the toughest pirate and drone fleets out on the edges of the sector. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers, and the Solar Flare also includes built-in Augmented Drives to allow the ship to keep up with the rest of the fleet. ",,,
stardust_vortexhunter,SHIP,"Built on the same base frame as the Cosmic Wind, the Vortex Hunter skips the bulky fighter bays for extra speed and maneuverability which makes it excellent for hunting down exposed ships. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_cosmicfury,SHIP,"Based on stolen blueprints of what would become the Cosmic Wind and Vortex Hunter, this ship isn't quite sure if it wants to be a carrier or combat cruiser. The delicate Solar Shielding tech that used to be installed did not survive the pirate mechanics tinkering and has been replaced with Unstable Injectors to further increase the ship's speed.",,,
stardust_stormbringer,SHIP,"Swift for a battlecruiser but relatively fragile, the Storm Bringer is designed to take out enemy ships as quickly as possible to avoid getting into a protracted fight. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_comettail,SHIP,"A fast but fragile missile frigate, the Comet Tail gets its name from the single broad engine trail that it leaves. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_plasmaburst,SHIP,"A prototype super heavy fighter, the Plasma Burst ended up being too large to base out of carriers. While incredibly fast, it is fragile and lacks the cargo and fuel to travel far on its own and does best as a fleet support ship. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_warpdiver,SHIP,"An electronic warfare destroyer, the Warp Diver excels at both system reconnaissance and fleet support. It is a bit more expensive to run than similar hulls, however, and has considerably less firepower available. Like all Stardust Ventures ships it is hardened against environmental dangers.",,,
stardust_meteorite,SHIP,"Fast and armed with a pair of light proton guns the meteorite wing can provide both effective ship strafing as well as enemy missile and fighter interception. The lack of any heavier ordience does mean they cannot do much more than provide pressure against most war ships, however.",,,
stardust_stormwing,SHIP,"A tough and well armored fighter armed with a pair of low power Fel weapons and a single Cloudburst missile, the stormwing fighters are designed for battlespace superiority against enemy craft.",,,
stardust_moonbreaker,SHIP,"Light, quick, and armed with a hard hitting Lithobreaker torpedo, the Moonbreaker is fairly fragile and works best when escorted to its target. ",,,
stardust_stormlight,SHIP,"This rare gunship design packs an array of weaponry that rivals even some small frigates. However, it can be easily overwhelmed if it tries to take on too many enemy fighters at once. ",,,
stardust_lightproton,WEAPON,"An attempt to reverse-engineer the technology of the Mjolnir cannon, the Proton Gun is considerably weaker and has shorter range but does allow for rapid fire. The highly polarized Proton shells create a mini EMP effect on ships hit with them. ",,,
stardust_dualproton,WEAPON,"An attempt to reverse-engineer the technology of the Mjolnir cannon, the Proton Gun is considerably weaker and has shorter range but does allow for rapid fire. The highly polarized Proton shells create a mini EMP effect on ships hit with them. ",,,
stardust_heavyproton,WEAPON,"A larger version of the Proton Gun, the Heavy Proton Gun still lacks the power and range of the Mjolnir but the EMP burst from the shells can be an effective ship disabler. While strong against lightly armored targets, it works best when paired with a weapon to strip off armor from more hardened targets.",,,
stardust_felrepeater,WEAPON,"A flux efficient Free-Electron Laser weapon that fires in short bursts. While fairly low powered, the stream of electrons fired by this weapon can still cause considerable damage as well as having an EMP effect on the target.
