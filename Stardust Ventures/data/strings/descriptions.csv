stardust_ventures,FACTION,"Stardust Ventures was a minor shipyard during the years of the Domain, focused almost exclusively on the creation of long range exploration and colonization ships. Their proprietary core system allowed safe passage through hyperspace storms and other dangerous phenomena. With the collapse of the gate system, however, many of the crucial parts necessary are now no longer available, and the company was forced to make do with what can be created locally. The instability of the sector and its growing piracy also spurred the creation of a whole combat line of ships to help escort what were once the primary focus of the entire enterprise. These days the company has carved out a small niche in the sector, selling ships and weapons to various factions and independent explorers. It is uncertain if such a relatively weak group can maintain that neutrality forever or if they will be subsumed into one of the larger powers.",,,

In the years since it has grown into a city state of its own, albeit under the control of its largest employer. Years of relative peace and a steady export economy have allowed the residents to build up a life of freedom and prosperity, at least compared to most other planets in the sector.",,,
stardust_brabant,CUSTOM,"Initially set up by a group of residents from Stardust Hall who disliked the omnipresent control of the megacorp, Brabant has grown into an independent but integral part of the system. Providing a steady stream of raw materials for the shipyards, the settlement relies on its larger neighbor for protection against both pirates and the politics of the sector at large.",,,
stardust_mystical_grilltopia,CUSTOM,"The whimsical moniker of this world was once just the name of an enterprising waystation crew member’s restaurant that quickly became synonymous with the fledgling settlement.

stardust_wayfarers_rest,CUSTOM,"Initially a simple resupply station, Wayfarer’s Rest had enough potential to receive a substantial amount of attention from SDV higher ups.
