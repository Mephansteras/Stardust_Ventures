[b][i]A ship pack centered around light, fast Midline ships that excel at long distance exploration missions. All of them have extended fuel range, larger than normal fuel tanks, and built in resistance to hyperspace hazards. While they integrate well with any midline or high-tech fleet, the Stardust Ventures ships are designed to work best as a cohesive fleet. In fact, the more of them in your fleet the higher a bonus to agility you get for the entire fleet in hyperspace![/i][/b]

Light Proton Gun        Dual Proton Gun        Heavy Proton Gun        Proton Autocannon

Diana's Darts, Arrows, and Spears - Fires out bursts of self-guided shells that home in on the targeted ship. Comes in Fragmentation, High Explosive, and Kinetic varieties for all three sizes. Currently only found on mercenary and Sindrian ships.

Fel Weapons (Free-Electron Lasers) - Pulse energy weapons with longer range than vanilla pulse lasers, lower damage, with a bit of EMP thrown in.

Plasma casters - Good damage against both hull and armor with a fairly low OP and flux cost, the plasma casters only real drawback is their slow fire rate and mediocre ability to take down shields on their own.

Mist Point Defense System - Slow firing but very cost effective energy based PD

Cloudburst missile launchers - Fires a guided missile that splits apart near the target into multiple warheads. These warheads explode into large clouds of charged energy. Effective both as area of effect defense against missiles and fighters and for finishing off damaged ships, the Cloudburst makes for a good multi-purpose combat missile.

Single    Triple        Pod            Stormfront launcher

Lithobreaker Torpedo launchers - Fires a guided torpedo that releases a high powered kinetic shot at the target when in range. Useful in both mining and warfare.

Streak MRMs - Very fast guided missiles with fairly low payloads. Excellent for taking out smaller vessels. Comes in Amber (frag), Azure (kinetic), Crimson (energy) and Violet (HE). Has small, medium, and large mount versions.

Pirate Weapon - The Walloper, two Thumpers strapped together for twice the fun! Makes for a really cheap large slot weapon, and can prove surprisingly effective in the right situations
